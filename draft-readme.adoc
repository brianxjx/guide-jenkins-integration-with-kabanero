= Jenkins integration with Kabanero

Kabanero delivers a modern DevOps toolchain with pre-built Tekton pipelines. The Tekton open source project provides Kubernetes-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines. While it is advantageous to run both CI and CD with Tekton to leverage the power of Kubernetes, some might want to reuse Jenkins assets or skills.

With Kabanero, you can customize the deployment section of the pipeline to use Jenkins.

In this guide, you will learn how to use Tekton to build an image and how to use Jenkins to deploy an application that uses that image. The link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines[kabanero-pipelines] repository contains a collection of Tekton tasks and pipelines that are intended to work out of the box with the featured Kabanero collections to illustrate a CI/CD work flow.
The pipelines and tasks can be executed manually or via a webhook. Both ways to create and run Tekton pipelines are shown in this guide.

The following diagram depicts the relationship and flow between Tekton and Jenkins:

== Prerequisites
You need the following prerequisites to complete the guide:

* link:https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform[OpenShift 4.2+] OR link:https://www.okd.io/[OKD 3.11+]
* link:https://github.com/Kabanero-io/Kabanero-foundation[Kabanero Foundation] (cloned and installed)
// Kabanero Pipelines
* link:https://github.com/Kabanero-io/Kabanero-pipelines[Kabanero Pipelines] (cloned)
// Appsody Installation
* link:http://appsody.dev[Appsody] (installed)

See each project's documentation for necessary system requirements.

== Intended audience
The purpose of the guide is to show an existing Jenkins user or administrator how to build an image with Tekton and how to deploy an image with Jenkins. Users should have experience with Jenkins and be familiar with the fundamental concepts of microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, and Tekton.

When building the image, you can follow one of the two methods mentioned below - either via automated webhook or by manual pipeline creation.

== Build an image with Tekton via Automated Webhook

. Log in as cluster-admin in the master node of your OKD Cluster. The following steps consider that you are logged in as cluster-admin and the commands are run on the master node of your OKD cluster.
. While logged in as a cluster-admin, execute the install script from the kabanero-operator link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-foundation[release]. For example, at the time of writing this guide, the command is: 
+
----
curl -s -L https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-operator/releases/download/0.3.2/install.sh | bash
----
+
. Create an instance of Kabanero CR by invoking the command you'll see as output near the end of the above installation script. For example, for Kabanero Foundation 0.3.2, the command is as following:
+
----
oc apply -n kabanero -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-operator/0.3.2/config/samples/default.yaml 
----
+
. Find out Tekton Dashboard URL by invoking the following command:
+
----
kubectl get routes -n tekton-pipelines
----
+
The output should look something like:
+
----
NAME               HOST/PORT                                                         PATH   SERVICES           PORT           
tekton-dashboard   tekton-dashboard-tekton-pipelines.apps.kabanero.os.fyre.ibm.com          tekton-dashboard   <all>   
----
+
. From Tekton Dashboard, navigate to Webhooks and click on the '+' sign "Create Webhook".
. Under "Webhook Settings", give your webhook a name, a repository URL and access token. The webhook name can be anything. For this example, we'll using a Java MicroProfile pipeline and thus, your codebase should be Java-MicroProfile based. If you don't have one, you can fork link:https://github.com/dewan-ahmed/java-microprofile[this repo]. To learn how to create a Personal Access Token for GitHub, follow link:https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[this link]
. Under "Target Pipeline Settings", select "Kabanero" namespace, "java-microprofile-build-push-pipeline" Pipeline, "kabanero-operator" Service Account, your Docker Registry URL in the form image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/<projectname> 
. Go to PipelineRuns tab. If you haven't created PipelineRuns already, the list should be empty.
. On your GitHub, go to Settings-->Webhooks. You should see newly created webhook which was created by the Tekton Dashboard. 
. Now make any code change on your repository and push. Wait few moments and you should see a PipelineRun kick off under PipelineRuns tab on your Tekton Dashboard.
. Once the PipelineRun finishes successfully, log in to your Docker Registry and find the newly created image. The image will reside under a repository with the same name as your GitHub repository.

 
== Build an image with Tekton by manual pipeline creation

=== Create a pipeline
The script to create a pipeline is included with the Kabanero Pipelines project. This template script contains both build and deployment tasks, but you will remove the deployment task from the file so that Tekton performs only the build task.

Go to the `kabanero-pipelines` folder that you recently cloned. Find the `pipelines/incubator/build-deploy-pipeline.yaml` file, and delete the following section of the file:

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: deploy-task
      taskRef:
        name: CollectionId-deploy-task
      runAfter: [build-task]
      resources:
        inputs:
        - name: git-source
          resource: git-source
        - name: docker-image
          resource: docker-image
----

You removed the deployment task. Save and close the file. Rename the file to `test-build-pipeline.yaml`.

In the `test-build-pipeline.yaml` file, update the name of the build task to `nodejs-express-build-task`. The taskRef name must be one of the tasks that is installed in the OpenShift cluster. Then, update the pipeline name to `test-build-pipeline`. After you make these changes, your file looks like following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: Tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: test-build-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
    - name: git-source
      type: git
    - name: docker-image
      type: image
  tasks:
    - name: build-task
      taskRef:
        name: nodejs-express-build-task
      resources:
      inputs:
        - name: git-source
          resource: git-source
      outputs:
        - name: docker-image
          resource: docker-image
----

Now, run the following command to create the pipeline:
----
oc apply -f test-build-pipeline.yaml -n Kabanero
----

In the command, the `-n` indicates the Kabanero namespace where the pipeline is created.

=== Create a PipelineRun binary
*Note:* You can use a project of your choice to complete this guide. If you don’t have a project yet, run the `appsody init nodejs-express` command to get a sample Node.js - Express application.

Go to the Kabanero Foundation project that you cloned and open the `scripts/appsody-Tekton-example-manual-run.sh` file. In this file, edit the `DOCKER_IMAGE` and `APP_REPO` parameters to reflect the code repository and image repository of your choice. For this example, use the Docker repository on OpenShift.

Run the following command to create a PipelineRun binary:
----
./appsody-Tekton-example-manual-run.sh
----

Run the following command to see the running PipelineRuns:
----
oc get pipelinerun
----

Run the following command to display the PipelineRun execution steps:
----
oc get pipelinerun -o yaml
----

If the PipelineRun fails at the `validate-collection-is-active` step, remove the `appsody/nodejs-express:<ver>` value and add the `Kabanero/nodejs-express:<ver>` value in the `appsody-config.yaml` file under the Appsody project.

This problem is a known issue for projects that are created by using the `appsody-init` command.

=== Create an image and push it to Docker
Log in to your OpenShift dashboard and select the Kabanero namespace. Navigate to Overview -> Builds -> `<project-name>`, where `<project-name>` is your GitHub project name. You can now see the image that you created.

== Deploy an image with Jenkins

=== Create a Jenkinsfile
Use the Jenkinsfile template from the reference section of this guide, and change the Docker Hub source to your own image repository. Push this Jenkinsfile to your GitHub repository in the root location.

=== Create a deploy file
On your local environment where Appsody is installed, go to your project folder and run the following command to generate an `app-deploy.yaml` file:
----
appsody-deploy –-generate-only
----

Other tools, including Jenkins, can use this file for application deployment. Commit and push this file to the root of your project. Jenkins creates the `AppsodyApplication` resource in the OpenShift cluster and uses Appsody to deploy the application by using `app-deploy.yaml` file.

=== Create a Jenkins project and pipeline
Create a Jenkins (Ephemeral) instance from the OpenShift Catalog. Create a project and specify GitHub as the source. Provide your GitHub account and repository details and choose multi-branch pipeline creation. Jenkins automatically detects the Jenkinsfile in your GitHub repository and starts the deployment process.

=== Verify deployment
Go to Application -> Deployment in your OpenShift portal to see the successful deployment. You can also see the URL of running application by going to Application -> Deployment -> Routes.

== Reference
* The following file is a sample Jenkinsfile that you can use to set up your initial Jenkinsfile for the guide. The user will need to adjust these values: *envVars: [ envVar(key: 'TAG', value: 'cbc2f7c'), envVar(key: 'IMAGENAME', value: 'appsodyjava'), envVar(key: 'PROJECT', value: 'kabanero')])*

        stage('Deploy') {
            container('kubectl') {
                checkout scm
                sh 'sed -i -e \'s#applicationImage: .*$#applicationImage: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/\'$PROJECT\'/\'$IMAGENAME\':\'$TAG\'#g\' app-deploy.yaml'
                sh 'cat app-deploy.yaml'
                sh 'find . -name app-deploy.yaml -type f|xargs kubectl apply -f'
            }
        }   
    }    
}
